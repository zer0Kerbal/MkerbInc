		// Rad
		#MKERB-Rad-Title = Micro Radiation Device Observation
		#MKERB-Rad-default = You observe the KKL device.

		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = So, radiation is bad, huh?
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Oh. Wow. Yes, this runway. You have all of the cosmos at your fingertips, and here you sit looking at hydrons on the runway. Fascinating.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You notice a distinct lack of humidity. Maybe that's why it's so hot?
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You're amazed that the device doesn't break as you fill it with water.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinSrfSplashedShores = There's almost no radiation in this water. That's probably good.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinSrfLandedShores = The device confirms that this is, in fact, sand. You decide to stop listening to KKL devices.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There's a disturbingly high amount of radiation here. Probably just the R&D department.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinFlyingLow = You manage to fiddle around with the device while sailing through the atmosphere. No new knowledge is gained, but you mak a mess in the process.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinFlyingHigh = Radiation is increasing steadily as you leave the atmosphere.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinInSpaceLow = The KKL seems to get confused about the inside and the outside of the device.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinInSpaceLow = I think the Kerbal race just culminated at this point.
		#MKERB-Rad-KerbinInSpaceHigh = You eat popcorn as you watch Kerbin get smaller. You never though you could use the KKL for this. Don't tell R&D.
		#MKERB-Rad-EveInSpace = The device makes a strange whirring noise. Maybe you've been in space for too long?
		#MKERB-Rad-DunaInSpace = The radiation here is only a bit higher than at Kerbin, which is good news.
		#MKERB-Rad-DunaSrfLanded = Pick a low radition spot for your house Jeb!
		#MKERB-Rad-DresInSpace = Strange readings here
		#MKERB-Rad-DresSrfLanded = you don't dare to touch the device.
		#MKERB-Rad-IkeInSpace = The KKL seems to not work at the moment.
		#MKERB-Rad-IkeSrfLanded = The KKL glows in strange colors. 
		#MKERB-Rad-MunInSpace = The device shows that the sun seems to have a larger influence on Mun that on Kerbin. 
		#MKERB-Rad-MunSrfLanded = Mundust..... X#X%##++#$$X%.
		#MKERB-Rad-MunSrfLanded = You let in some Munar dust and close the hatch. Let it get bombarded by paticles and see if the sand splits like an katom.
		#MKERB-Rad-MunFlyingLow = It now smells like burnt toast, though that may be leftover while KKL maintanance was underway.
		#MKERB-Rad-MunFlyingHigh = Is this really a good idea? Staring at the cratered surface below, you're beginning to wonder...
		#MKERB-Rad-MinmusInSpace = There is no change in how the device reads. Probably because Minmus is despicably tiny - you should get a closer look. 
		#MKERB-Rad-MinmusSrfLanded = The device stutters and vibrates. Perhaps there is something radioactive underneath Minmus's surface?
		#MKERB-Rad-InSpace = There seems to be less radiation inside the device than outside...
		#MKERB-Rad-NeidonInSpace = Where are the rad suits again.
		#MKERB-Rad-NeidonSrfLanded = Raditation overlo#*@X2+

		#MKERB-Rad-PlockInSpace = Radiation seems to be very high.
		#MKERB-Rad-PlockInSpace = Danger Danger!

		#MKERB-Rad-SarnusSrfLanded = This is the perfct place for particle bombarding.

		#MKERB-Rad-PoltaInSpace = The KKL makes a humming noise.
		#MKERB-Rad-PoltaSrfLanded = You wonder who gave it the name Kerbin Kolider Lurk

		#MKERB-Rad-UrlumInSpace = Radition is moderate here.
		#MKERB-Rad-UrlumSrfLanded = This seems to be a radiation hotspot

		#MKERB-Rad-WalInSpace = You envy the guys in Kernobil now.
		#MKERB-Rad-WalSrfLanded = Your dosimeter broke.

		#MKERB-Rad-HaleInSpace = You wonder if radiation softens the skin.
		#MKERB-Rad-HaleSrfLanded = You use some ration chocklate to make a skin cream.	

		#MKERB-Rad-TektoInSpace = You think you could boil eggs on the hull.
		#MKERB-Rad-TektoSrfLanded = Strangely the radiation seems to be not so harsh.

		#MKERB-Rad-PriaxInSpace = You forget to switch it on.
		#MKERB-Rad-PriaxSrfLanded = It tickels, this can't be good.

		#MKERB-Rad-ErnusInSpace = Everything radiates in fancy colors.
		#MKERB-Rad-ErnusSrfLanded = The rad detector is not working anymore

		#MKERB-Rad-AstidInSpace = There is no radiation here.
		#MKERB-Rad-AstidSrfLanded = Only small radation readings.

		#MKERB-Rad-ApturInSpace = Good results measured here.
		#MKERB-Rad-ApturSrfLanded = The ground seems to suck up space radiation

		#MKERB-Rad-EliInSpace = Kernobil would be like a summer camp.
		#MKERB-Rad-EliSrfLanded = WARNING: HIGH RADITATION

		#MKERB-Rad-NolasInSpace = Maybe some space junk is cause for wrong readings
		#MKERB-Rad-NolasSrfLanded = This place should be named Kukushima.

		#MKERB-Rad-TitanusInSpace = The radiation is dangerous here
		#MKERB-Rad-TitanusSrfLanded = XE§$#+****

		#MKERB-Rad-VanorInSpace = Jeb don't put butter on the device!
		#MKERB-Rad-VanorSrfLanded = The radiation seems strange here.

		// Time
		#MKERB-Time-Title = Liquid clock Observation

		#MKERB-Time-KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Tick... tock... tick... tock...,
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The clock seems to be ticking painfully slowly while preparing for launch... but it's just your imagination.
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinSrfLandedRunway = I know! Let's just tack clocks onto everything. Science here we come.
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Time is actually a little dilated here. There doesn't happen to be any large, ancient relics around here, are there?
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The water definitely slows the clock down.
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You start to question why you brought a clock if you're just going to use it at KSC.
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinFlyingLow = The clock IS slower, but that's probably due to resistance from the atmosphere.
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinFlyingHigh = The clock really is getting slower now. But, like, negligibly slower.
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinInSpaceLow = Interestingly, time is actually slowed about 0.0000000014%. Ish.
		#MKERB-Time-KerbinInSpaceHigh = As you get farther away from Kerbin, time passes every so slightly faster than normal. Future instrumentation will be built to account for this.
		#MKERB-Time-MunInSpace = As you approach the mass of the Mun, time is beginning to dilate again.
		#MKERB-Time-MunSrfLanded = Time dilation definitely correlates with gravitational pull and velocity.
		#MKERB-Time-MunFlyingLow = Time is slowly getting faster again as gravity overtakes orbital velocity.
		#MKERB-Time-MunFlyingHigh = The clock spins wildly out of control! Oh, no, wait, you just have it wired incorrectly.
		#MKERB-Time-MinmusInSpace = You could've sworn that the clock just whispered that it loves you.
		#MKERB-Time-MinmusSrfLanded = There's no effect on the passage of time. Probably because Minmus has a very small mass.
		#MKERB-Time-GillyInSpace = Really? Did you really expect that a body of this size would dilate time? Learn how to physics.
		#MKERB-Time-InSpace = The clock is still running slightly faster than it had on Kerbin.
		#MKERB-Time-LaytheInSpace = This reminds you of the long summers on Kerbin beach.
		#MKERB-Time-LaytheSrfLanded = Fishing time on a lake!
		#MKERB-Time-NeidonInSpace = Time is not relevant anymore.
		#MKERB-Time-NeidonSrfLanded = You bet you will be late for your date with Valery.
		#MKERB-Time-PlockInSpace = You bet Kerbin has overuled the top/bottom equator time system till they see this message.
		#MKERB-Time-PlockSrfLanded = The clock suddenly stops.
		#MKERB-Time-SarnusInSpace = You dont look at the clock.
		#MKERB-Time-SarnusSrfLanded = The clock seems to read your thoughts.
		#MKERB-Time-PoltaInSpace = The clock seems to slowly tick backwards.
		#MKERB-Time-PoltaSrfLanded = You will not forget the present for mothers day, a Plota Stone.
		#MKERB-Time-UrlumInSpace = Time seems to slow down here quite a bit.
		#MKERB-Time-UrlumSrfLanded = 1 Hour is like 2 days on here.Better get a move on.

		#MKERB-Time-WalInSpace = You beginn seeing two clocks.
		#MKERB-Time-WalSrfLanded = You throw one of the imaginery clocks out of the ship.

		#MKERB-Time-HaleInSpace = This thing has been around since the great bang.
		#MKERB-Time-HaleSrfLanded = History for the hands and minds but the clock does not seem to care.

		#MKERB-Time-OvokInSpace = The Signal strengh is 9,5%. Delay 9.89 seconds
		#MKERB-Time-OvokSrfLanded = The Signal strengh is 7%. Delay 15.89 seconds

		#MKERB-Time-SlateInSpace = Time slate.....
		#MKERB-Time-SlateSrfLanded = Its hard to keep track of time so far away from home.

		#MKERB-Time-PriaxInSpace = The clock makes fun of you.
		#MKERB-Time-PriaxSrfLanded = You debate to build a clock of Priax dust.

		#MKERB-Time-ErnusInSpace = The liqud behaves normally.
		#MKERB-Time-ErnusSrfLanded = The clock does still tick.

		#MKERB-Time-AtellInSpace = Looks like some wires are hanging out. JEEB!!
		#MKERB-Time-AtellSrfLanded = Some liquid does spill out of the device.

		#MKERB-Time-ApturInSpace = Time does go in strange ways here.
		#MKERB-Time-ApturSrfLanded = It seems like there are time holes here somewhere.

		#MKERB-Time-LaveInSpaceHigh = The time is 42 o clock now.
		#MKERB-Time-LaveSrfLanded = Could this be a new time zone ?

		#MKERB-Time-TitanusInSpace = Time runs much faster here.
		#MKERB-Time-TitanusSrfLanded = X#+"XD

		#MKERB-Time-VanorInSpace = There are strange readings.
		#MKERB-Time-VanorSrfLanded = The device is borked.

		// Sound
		#MKERB-Sound-Title = Sound Device Observation
		#MKERB-Sound-default = You observe the soundwaves....

		#MKERB-Sound-KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Flight Control deactivates the device remotly.
		#MKERB-Sound-KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You romp about the KSC playing space music from several popular movies. Spirits are so lifted around KSC that we actually gain science points from this.
		#MKERB-Sound-KerbinFlyingLow = ...%X##+*X733t
		#MKERB-Sound-KerbinFlyingHigh = As the air pressure drops, your ability to get data diminishes severely.
		#MKERB-Sound-KerbinInSpaceLow = Recorded data is very strange - still showing a very, very small pressure wave produced. How could there be pressure waves in a vacuum?
		#MKERB-Sound-KerbinInSpaceHigh = There might be some unseen particles in the vacuum of space.
		#MKERB-Sound-MunSrfLanded = Nothing happens, of course.
		#MKERB-Sound-MunFlyingLow = Amounts of the newly detected particle are definitely decreasing as we get further into the Mun's gravity well.
		#MKERB-Sound-MunFlyingHigh = Based on this data, scientists at KSC are theorizing that this may be a new type of particle.
		#MKERB-Sound-MinmusInSpace = This data shows that there may be a new type of particle
		#MKERB-Sound-MinmusSrfLanded = The scientists at KSC have not yet found a name for the new particle.
		#MKERB-Sound-InSpace = We're no longer able to track anything on the new particle. 

		#MKERB-Sound-GillyInSpace = So small you could swallow it and make sound training with it.
		#MKERB-Sound-GillySrfLanded = You don't even bother.

		#MKERB-Sound-NeidonInSpace = No one will hear your screams!
		#MKERB-Sound-NeidonSrfLanded = You are scared that you will never hear another kerbal.

		#MKERB-Sound-TektoInSpace = Looks like a sound chamber.
		#MKERB-Sound-TektoSrfLanded = You try to make a sound but nothing come out of your mouth.

		#MKERB-Sound-LaytheInSpace = Water sounds. How you miss them!
		#MKERB-Sound-LaytheSrfLanded = You hear some water or did you just dream that ?

		#MKERB-Sound-EelooInSpace = Looks like a gigant ice berg.
		#MKERB-Sound-EelooSrfLanded = Its to cold to press the button.

		#MKERB-Sound-ErnusInSpace = The heat does generate intresting data.
